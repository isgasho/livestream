# Steve Klabnik's Livestream

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is the repository I use to [stream some Rust
programming][stream]. I stream at [5:15 CST on Tuesdays][stream-time],
usually for between an hour and two hours. I may start streaming at other
days or times in the future, and every once in a while I'll do something
different as a one-off.

Right now, I am re-building the [semver crate][semver-crate]. I've been meaning
to get it to 1.0.0 for years, and we're going to be doing that together.

This repository is where I'm pushing up the code after each session, but it's
also a place where [you can open issues][issues] or comment on them if you'd
like to ask a question I didn't cover on stream, or influence what I decide
to work on next.
